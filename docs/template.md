## For moderators or/and anyone else

>[!Caution]
As a result of several personal problems I've had over the last few months + my final exams coming up very soon, I'm currently unable to look at my GitHub notifications every day and maintain my executions correctly.
If you detect a certain problem on a certain pul request:
- Either you can close the pull request directly without mentioning me.
- Or you can send me a message on X (Twitter): @Exorcism0666

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm sorry if some pull requests can't be approved due to the situation I'm in.
